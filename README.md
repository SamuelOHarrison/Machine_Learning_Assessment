# Machine_Learning_Assessment
Repo for all code for my machine learning module at university

# Question 1
Question 1 was a task to find the most suitable type of regression for the given data set

# Question 2
Question 2 was a task to create visualisations from a set of data about the genes of a population of an island.
Using Principal Components Analysis I was able to separate out the different gene pools and make
inferences about the different types of people that migrated to the island.
